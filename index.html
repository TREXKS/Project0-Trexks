      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>It is time to start making the world a bit greener. There is no debate that the world is
      changing due to our treatment and pollution of the planet, and if left untreated, the generations that follow will suffer.</p>
      <p>Vertical Gardens is a project to promote the use of indoor gardens and hydroponic systems within popular cities.

      out the technology and ideas in place to start facilitating construction of Vertical Gardens and what will need to be done to make it a reality. </p>
